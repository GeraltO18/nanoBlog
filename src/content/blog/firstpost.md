This is my first blog post and let me say few things about myself and why this blog. I am making this blog on June 03 2024, 2 days from becoming 1 YOE SDE. Currently, I am working at SoftwareAG but soon to be joining IBM (SAG sold the webmethods to IBM) and things are smooth so far but the future is definitly not satisfying but let's not loose hope...âœŒ

#### Why the blog ?
Well, Its been almost 1 year since I have joined SAG, I have learned a lot. But the problem is, I dont keep track of what all I have learnt and done. Not just acheivements but also things like mistakes, advices, mess ups. 

>Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

So I decided to do blogging that would help me keep track of things that i have done as well as a way to showcase my works. Which is a win-win for me. Anyways, Hope you like my works and thank you for your time.
